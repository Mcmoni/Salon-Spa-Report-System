## Overview

This web app is designed for salons and spas to efficiently manage client records and business performance. It allows receptionists to record client details such as services, payment methods, phone numbers, and amounts paid. The system provides summaries and statistics by day, week, and month, by service and in total.

Two user interfaces are available:
- **Receptionist interface:** For inputting client info and viewing records.
- **Admin interface:** For analyzing statistics, performance trends, and management.

The app integrates with **Hubtel SMS** to automatically send thank-you messages upon client data submission and save numbers for future promotions. It also tracks client visit counts to support loyalty rewards programs.
